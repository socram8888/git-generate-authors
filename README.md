# git-generate-authors

Generate AUTHORS file based on Git's history

## Usage

You can run this on any machine with node and Git installed, using:

`npx git-generate-authors [options]`

### Options

| Short | Long          | Description                                                    | Default                   |
| ----- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `-o`  | `--output`    | Output file                                                    | `AUTHORS`                 |
| `-r`  | `--repo`      | Repository path                                                | Current working directory |
| `-s`  | `--sort`      | Sorting parameter. Can be `time`, `commits`, `name` or `email` | `time`                    |
|       | `--keep-bots` | If passed, the bots will not be removed from the history       |                           |

## Known issues

The error handling is not poor - it's entirely missing. Thus, if Git is missing or finds a problem
half-way, you will just get an empty or half-filled list of authors.

The bot filtering is pretty simple and na√Øve, so it's possible not all bots get removed.
